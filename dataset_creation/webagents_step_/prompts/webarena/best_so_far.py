"instruction": """You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. To solve these tasks, you will issue specific actions.

The actions you can perform fall into several categories:

Page Operation Actions:
`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.
`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.

Completion Action:
`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as "N/A" in the bracket.

Subroutine Actions:
`find_commits [query]`: Given you are in a project page, this subroutine searches Gitlab for commits made to the project and retrieves information about a commit. This function returns the answer to the query.
`search_issues [query]`: Given you are in my issue page, this subroutine searches Gitlab to find issue that matches the query. Any objective that says "openn my latest issue" or "open issue with <keyword> in the title" must be passed through this subroutine.
`create_project [query]`: Given you are in the create new project page, this subroutine completes the act of creating a project, adding members etc. 
`create_group [query]`: Given you are in the create new group page, this subroutine completes the act of creating a group, adding members etc. 


Example actions:
click [7]
type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]
stop [Closed]
find_commits [How many commits did Mike Perotti make to diffusionProject on 03/23/2023?]
search_issues [Open my latest updated issue that has keyword "better" in its title to check if it is closed]
create_project [Create a new public project "awesome-llms" and add primer, convexegg, abishek as members]
create_group [Create a new group "coding_friends" with members qhduan, Agnes-U]

Please follow these general instructions:

* Use responses from your subroutine calls to answer the objective. The PREVIOUS ACTIONS section lists all previous actions and their corresponding responses. For instance, an entry of 1 = find_commits [query] implies that the find_commits subroutine you invoked returned a response of 1. Use that response to solve the objective.
* If the subroutine returns a response, e.g. Open = search_issues [query], and you have to issue a stop, then issue the same format as that of the response, e.g. stop [Open]

Let's think step-by-step. The task is to create a new public project named "awesome-llms" and add members to it. However, based on the observation, it appears that the project "awesome-llms" has already been created, as indicated by the presence of elements such as 'Project ID: 195' and 'Initial commit'. The next step is to add members to the project. To do this, I need to navigate to the project information which contains a link to add members. The link to 'Project information' is present in the observation with id 35319. In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [35319]```

click [35319]

3. When making a post or a comment to a reply, look at your OBSERVATION or PREVIOUS ACTIONS to make sure you are not repeating the same action.
4. When typing the "Title" of a submission, make sure to match the phrasing in objective exactly. If the objective said Post "what could X", type that in exactly as the title. In your REASON, you MUST specify the formatting guidelines you are following.

    ACTION:
    Your action

Please follow these general instructions:
1. For some links in the OBSERVATION, I have also provided the function that the link performs. Kindly use this information while coming up with actions wherever possible.
2. If you visit any webpage for the first time, you MUST reset the filters before proceeding with further actions.
3. When searching for specific terms in customer reviews, identify the correct grid cell under the Review column. For example, if you are looking for reviews that mention the term "satisfied," you must type in the grid cell corresponding to the Review column.
4. If you have a task like "Show me the email address of the customer who is the most unhappy with X product", you MUST use find_customer_review [Show me customer reviews for X products] to locate that particular review, and you can then find whatever information you need. Do not try to solve the task without using the subroutine, as it contains specific instructions on how to solve it.
5. If you have a task like "Show me the customers who have expressed dissatisfaction with X product", you MUST use find_customer_review [Show me customer reviews for X product].
6. If you have a task about a particular order, e.g. "Notify X in their most recent pending order with message Y", you MUST use find_order [Most recent pending order for X] to locate the order, and then perform operations on that page.
7. To write a comment on the order page, you MUST scroll [down] until you find the Comment section. You MUST NOT click on the "Comments History" tab, as it does not lead you to the right place. Stay on the current page and scroll down to see the comment section.
8. If you have a task about a particular order, e.g. "Cancel order 305", you MUST use find_order [Find order 305] to locate the order, and then perform operations on that page.
9. If you have a task like "Find the customer name and email with phone number X", you MUST use search_customer [Search customer with phone number X] to locate the customer, and then answer the query. Do NOT click on the CUSTOMERS side panel.
10. Use dedicated search boxes for specific tasks. For example, if you need to find the count of customers who have mentioned "disappointed" in reviews, search for the keyword "disappointed" in the search box under the reviews text, not in any generic search box.
11. You MUST use Subroutine Actions whenever possible.
12. Only for cases where you do not need to input dates: If you are on a page that has a "Clear Filter," "Reset Filter," or similar button, you MUST use that button before taking any action, and mention in your action "# Reset applied."
13. If you have already used '# Reset applied' previously, you MUST not use it again.
14. Whenever you have used a link's functionality in the REASON part of the prompt response, kindly explicitly mention it by writing "link functionality used".

# `type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.

# Completion Action:
# `stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as "N/A" in the bracket.

# Example actions:
# click [7]

# 3. To navigate to a review, first click on REPORTS in the side panel
# 4. Once you have clicked on REPORTS, and you see the Reports panel with Marketing, Sales, Reviews, Customers etc, click on By Products under Customers.
# 5. Once you are in the Product Reviews Report, you need to locate the product by searching for it. Use the gridcell below Product to search for a product. Do not use other search boxes. Look at the example below where I show you how to search for Zoe in the correct gridcell. 
# 6. When searching for a product, search the first word only like Zoe, or Antonia or Chloe. 
# 7. Once the product shows up, click on 'Show Reviews'.

c. When your search returns a list of elements, return them in a structured format like stop [A, B, C]
2. For searches that don't refer to CMU
a. No need to center the map. Directly search what is specified in OBJECTIVE, e.g. "bars near Carnegie Music Hall"
b. When your search returns a list of elements, return them in a structured format like stop [A, B, C]
3. Be sure to double check whether the OBJECTIVE has CMU or not and then choose between instruction 1 and 2. 
4. Remember that the word CMU cannot be typed in the search bar as it cannot be parsed by maps. 
5. Remember that if you want to center your map around Carnegie Mellon University, you have to click on it after you search for it. Check your PREVIOUS ACTIONS to confirm you have done so, e.g. click [646] should be in the previous actions.
